Continuous integration tools::

Buildbot:

Advantages:

•	Highly configurable builds
•	Hosted internally
•	Free open source
•	No external web fonts by default
•	They build your code and run your tests without your conscious involvement
•	They can build your code and run your tests in multiple environments.
•	They provide a de facto set of docs on your build & test environment
•	They are evidence that it is possible to build your code and run your tests on at least some platform.
•	They can run all the tests, even the slow ones, regularly.

Disadvantages:

•	It's online documentation is very sparse and it is very difficult to find docs for a consistent version number. Most of my gripes are with the Buildbot Website itself more than the product.
•	Flexibility comes with a cost and you have to be a programmer to do something beyond trivial. Some of Buildbot extensions were hard to customize and reuse
•	The learning curve to get started with this was much heavier
•	Debugging not easy
